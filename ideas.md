have a button that says "oh my god, i should send this to—" that hyperlinks to a prefilled email saying something like
    subject: "Event that looks up your alley on Sept 21!"
    body: "Hey, I found this event that looks up your alley on Sept 21!
    I think you'd be interested in it.
    Here's the link: https://memoria.com
    Let me know if you're interested in going!
    Best,

have a button that says "oh my god, i should send this to—" that hyperlinks to a prefilled email saying something like
    subject: "SRS event that looks up your alley on Sept 21!"
    body: "Hey,

    I saw this and thought of you! It's an event for spaced repetition, incremental reading, and memory systems. Sept 21, in Berkeley CA.
    
    Here's the link: [insert link]"


a button to add it to your google calendar

some little note that says something like
"Hey! Saul here — each time I've hosted a smaller SRS meetups, people wanted to hang out for longer.

I'm really excited to see you all!" or prob something better, vaguely along the lines of austin's memo on minifest
